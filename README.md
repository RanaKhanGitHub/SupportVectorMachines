# Support Vector Machines
Mr. John Hughes would like you to revisit the cancer.csv dataset and create a standard and optimized SVM model. If you recall the dataset has the following variables.

# Independent Variables
ID - ID number
Clump Thickness - 1-10
UofCSize - Uniformity of Cell Size 1-10 UofShape - Uniformity of Cell Shape 1-10 Marginal Adhesion - 1-10
SECSize - Single Epithelial Cell Size 1-10 Bare Nuclei - 1-10
Bland Chromatin - 1-10
Normal Nucleoli - 1-10
Mitoses - 1-10

# Dependent Variable
Class 
Benign (i.e. No Cancer) - 2
Malignant (i.e. Cancer) - 4

Note: ID will not be used and will need to be dropped prior to building your model

# The Ask

1. Rational Statement (summary of the problem or problems to be addressed by the PPT)
2. Present the Learning Curve for the Original SVM Model and explain three (3) insights
3. Present and explain three (3) key insights from the Optimized SVM model classification report, but first use SMOTE to balance the Classes
4. State and explain three (3) recommendations for Mr. John Hughes for next steps
